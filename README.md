# IBM_dash_final.py
This is the unfinalized version of my simple dashboard layout using Dash in JupyterLabs, I'm posting it as I have an error I'm unfamiliar with in it.
The error brings back a callback error regarding the children of plots 1-5.
It functions, for the most part, as intended. The error messages just appears while loading the dashboard. After fully loading, one can choose between the dropdown menu options as normal.
